##  Kmeans-Clustering

#### Tasks
- Data Selection: Start by accessing Registry of Open Data on AWSLinks to an external site.. Browse through available data sets and select one that you find interesting or relevant to your area of study.
- Setup PyCharm: Ensure that PyCharmLinks to an external site., your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), is installed and set up correctly on your computer. If you need help with this, refer to the PyCharm documentation or seek assistance from your instructor.
- K-Means Application Development: Using the selected data set from AWS, develop a Python application that implements the K-Means algorithm. The main goal is to cluster your data meaningfully and thoughtfully.
- Unit Testing: After developing your application, it's important to test it to ensure it's working as expected. Conduct unit tests and debug any issues that may arise. Make sure your application is robust and can handle potential errors gracefully.
- Executive Summary: Upon completion of your application, create a one-page executive summary in Microsoft Word. This summary should provide an overview of your work, including the purpose of your application, the data set chosen, the results of your clustering, and any insights or conclusions drawn from the data. This document should be written in a way that even non-technical stakeholders can understand.
